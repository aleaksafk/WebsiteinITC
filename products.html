  document.getElementById("aleaks").innerHTML = "CamCord-ament is a contraction of a CamCorder and Ornament, which means that the CamCorder is within the ornament or the gem of an earring. The earrings lock is served as the on and off button of the CamCord-ament. It detects whether the earrings is being used or not. if it isn't, then it won't open, but if it is, the CamCord-ament will automatically open itself. The red light seen flashing on the camera or the Recording Lens indicates that the CamCord-ament is open and is currently recording everything from the moment you decided to wear it. Behind the camera, is an installed GPS and mic, so not only the CamCord-ament is capable of recording a video but it can also record an audio as well. So what is the purpose of a GPS installed inside of it? A feature is developed here where the GPS will send your exact location or coordinates to your trusted contact(s) in real time. In that way, you would leave a track and the receiver of the message will know your wherabouts, before any worst thing could happen. Not only your exact location will be sent, but also a 5 minute voice record, to hear your surroundings, 10 instant captures (photos) to see a certain landmark they can use to be familiarized about your location, and 1 (no definite length) video, which means that it depends on how long you have used the CamCord-ament. Take note that all of these will be sent to the receiver, every 2 hours of your usage. This will surely be helpful to leave evidences to your trusted contact(s) if something bad happens to you, so in that way, they would know where you are, how and what happened to you."
